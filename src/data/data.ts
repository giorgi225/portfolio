    blogDescription: `
      <p>Imperial Tours is a premium travel company in Georgia, offering diverse tour packages for travelers worldwide. The client approached me with a major challenge: their website was slow, outdated, and suffered from high bounce rates due to poor user experience.

        <li>The site lacked proper SEO optimization, affecting search engine rankings and reducing organic traffic.</li>
        <li>There was no real-time booking confirmation, leading to frequent double bookings and customer frustration.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h6>My Approach & Solutions:</h6>
      <p>I started the project by performing a <strong>full UI/UX redesign in Figma</strong>, focusing on a modern, intuitive design.

        <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> Worked closely with Laravel developers to create efficient API endpoints for seamless data exchange.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Booking System:</strong> Implemented a <strong>real-time availability check</strong> to prevent double bookings.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO & Accessibility Enhancements:</strong> Optimized <strong>meta tags, structured data, and Lighthouse performance metrics</strong>, achieving a 95+ SEO score.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Utilized <strong>lazy loading, caching, and optimized images</strong>, ensuring a smooth user experience.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h6>Results & Impact:</h6>
      <p>The new website achieved remarkable success:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Page load time reduced from <strong>6.2 seconds</strong> to <strong>1.3 seconds</strong>.</li>
        <li>Bookings increased by <strong>40%</strong> within the first two months.</li>
